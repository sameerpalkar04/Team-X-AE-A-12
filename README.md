Our project consists of a three way approach -:

The app and the smart watch: Modern smartwatches have various sensors which can detect a crash, When a crash is detected, The smartwatch can automatically connect you with emergency services and notify your emergency contacts. This is made possible by the gyroscope & accelorometer which is present in a smartwatch. At the same time the MyMedibuddy app on the watch will send signals to the MyMedibot stationed at the nearest police station, hospital or any other public area. This will activate the second approach.

The MyMedibot: Ambulances take time to reach the site of accident and sometimes immediate help cannot be provided to the person, to solve this problem we've come up with MyMedibot. It's a 2.5 x 2.5 feet fully automated polycarbonate robot. The RADAR module will enable the robot to navigate it's way to the crash site. On reaching the crash site, the people attending the patient can enter his/her name from their ID proof like driver's license. In case there is no one to attend the patient, the inbuilt siren will go off alerting the nearby people. The bot will also have a 5L oxygen cylinder and a Difriblator to provide immediate assistance. The screen will give all the instructions on how to provide the aid. The webcam can also connect them to a doctor giving them live instructions. This will help the patient by the time the ambulance arrives.

The Ambulance: After the ambulance arrives, the bot can give important details to the medical personnel like the patient's blood group, previous medical history etc.
